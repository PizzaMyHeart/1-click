# 1-Click
> Takes you to full articles of paywalled journals in just a click of a button.

This project was borne out of a long-standing frustration over how long it takes to get to the full version of an online journal article. [Some publishers](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/) require you to log in *every single time* you open a new article, even within the same browser session.


1-Click is a Chrome extension that injects a button into the first page you view upon accessing a paywalled article. Clicking the button takes you directly to your institution's login page; the full article is available after logging in. <sup>Technically it takes two clicks to get to the full article but it's still WAY quicker than slogging through an endless chain of links. Plus 2-clicks doesn't roll off the tongue in quite the same way.</sup>
